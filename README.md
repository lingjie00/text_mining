# Text Mining - Tracking Sentiments Change
This repo includes a series of text mining sentiment related scripts.

## Objective
The goal of this repo is to create an easy to use script for users to compare and constrast the change in sentiments either by comparing the different texts and/or different time periods.

## Usage
1. Save the text file as .csv or .txt
2. Change the filename in script
3. Run and done

## Current plan
1. First version: sentiment analysis on a single text (done)
2. Second version: sentiment analysis comparing multiple texts
3. Third version: sentiment analysis across time

## Issues pending
1. Sentiment library update
2. Weighing the cost and benefits of changing sentiment into a scoring system
